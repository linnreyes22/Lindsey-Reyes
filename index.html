                <p> An estimated 30 million dogs are slaughtered each year. Dog meat farms are scattered throughout the countryside, and the industry was estimated several years ago to be worth over US$200 million.In most countries, dogs are stolen pets or grabbed from the streets. In South Korea, dogs are farmed in appalling conditions.They are starved,beaten,and many other things that are just really sad for them to have to endure. The ways they are killed are chilling and unhuman. They are killed in the most horrific ways you can think of. Due to a traditional belief that high adrenaline levels will produce tender meat and increase the supposed health benefits, dogs who are killed may be intentionally subjected to extreme fear and suffering and be killed by bludgeoning, hanging, or electrocution. At the open-air markets, dogs are often electrocuted and their necks are broken,all in plain sight to bypassers and other dogs.</p>

                <p>We have to put a stop to dog meat trade because it's really sad that there is also a festival that exists out there where they kill dogs. What you can do to stop this is sign petitions and really make sure your voice is heard. The larger the number of people that sign onto the petitions, the stronger the push to end the Festival. The petitions are powerful and have worked in reaching the Chinese authorities. If you could and it would be possible the biggest thing you could do to help out is trying to adopt one of these dogs that has been rescued and giving it the best life and making sure they wont have to feel fear again.</p>
